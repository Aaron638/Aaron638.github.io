		<h2>General Education Reflection</h2>
		<p>&emsp;While I attended Iowa State University to pursue my degree in Computer Engineering, the general
			education courses I took taught me something about the universal need to solve problems.</p>
		<p>&emsp;In ARCH 321, History of the American City, I went through the journey of the urban centers of the
			United States. Starting from the early port cities of the Eastern coast, to the suburbias of the baby boom,
			to the sprawling urban centers we have today, many socioeconomic factors have undeniably been a main driving
			force for the movement of people and where they choose to live.</p>
		<p>&emsp;It was in this class where I first learned about the connection between economics and engineering. For
			example, as we followed the development of Washington D.C., we learned about the website
			mappingsegregationdc.org , which includes a visualization of aggregated census and real estate data to paint
			a picture of how demographics moved pre and post Civil Rights Movement. I was awestruck by how useful the
			topics I learned in web design could apply to the communication in societal movements.</p>
		<p>&emsp;Most of the other general education courses I have taken were covered by AP credits in high school.
			Similarly, these were courses on European and American history to cover HIST201 HIST202, and HIST221.</p>
		<p>&emsp;In these classes too, the power of data to visualize economic and global trends become very apparent.
			While AP European History did have a lot of content focusing on Europe, about half of the content was about
			Western and European Nation’s and how their actions affected the borders of other countries in other
			continents. </p>
		<p>&emsp;Right now in EE 330 Integrated Circuits, I am learning about the domination of asian semiconductor
			industries in VLSI technology around the 1980s and 90s. When looking at the history of TSMC, I found an
			unexpected connection to AP European History where it turns out that TSMC was formed as a “joint venture
			between the Taiwan government, which wanted to promote the development of the island's semiconductor
			industry, and Philips Electronics NV of The Netherlands.”(fundinguniverse.com) It turns out that even in the
			modern era, the country’s connection to Dutch colonial roots still has a profound impact on emerging
			technologies.</p>
		<p>&emsp;In AP US History (APUSH), we were shown how early American constitutional debates still have an effect
			on the dynamics of presidential election on the website fivethirtyeight.com. While the Founding Fathers
			originally designed the electoral college to balance the power of large and small states, changes in voter
			rights and expansions to nearby states have changed the way elections work as we evolve as a nation. Even
			now during this 2020 election, fivethirteight.com shows us the relevance of computer engineers in the field
			of data science with Monte Carlo simulations to try to predict voting patterns and motivations.</p>
		<p>&emsp;In conclusion, my experience with general education courses have expanded my views on what a Computer
			Engineer fundamentally is. Not only is this degree a means of earning a salary, but a means of interfacing
			between the complex, chaotic models and systems of the world. As an engineer I have the power to solve
			problems with code, and communicate them to others with interactive visualizations.</p>
		<p>&emsp;While before I wanted to live in the suburbs and be able to work remotely, I now want to be able to
			travel to cities across the world working on big picture problems that are hard to solve with human
			intuition alone.</p>

		<h2>Cumulative Reflection</h2>
		<p>&emsp;The ISU Computer Engineering curriculum has allowed me to choose a path anywhere within the broad field
			of Electrical and Computer Engineering. From the underlying physical interactions of the electrons that make
			up the electricity being used to power the computer that I am typing this essay on, to the design of high
			level interactions between various software APIs being used to deliver data across the world. I now have the
			power to apply knowledge to solve a problem.</p>
		<p>&emsp;There is this popular idea among the public where many of the subjects you are taught throughout your
			education don’t have relevance in the job you are going to end up in. It becomes obvious that that sentiment
			is narrow-minded when one realizes the sheer size of the field. There are many patterns that emerge from
			classes that seem to have nothing to do with each other. These patterns are usually lessons in problem
			solving, and the way knowledge builds on each other.</p>
		<p>&emsp;In CPRE 288, I had to work with a partner to solve simple problems in the Embedded Systems lab every
			week. Near the end of the semester, we got together with another pair of students, and we were given an open
			ended design problem: Create a system to control a robot through an obstacle course with only the sensors it
			was equipped with.</p>
		<p>&emsp;Understanding the importance of planning in open-ended problem solving was the main takeaway for the
			four of us. While previously we had only been assigned small projects that have a “right answer”, I learned
			that problems in the real world would require a different approach.</p>
		<p>&emsp;In another class, COMS 309, I and 3 other students had created an Android Application which lets users
			play a large game of Hide and Seek with the GPS on their phones. Very quickly I learned that the TAs and the
			professor would not be able to personally teach us, as there were hundreds of groups, and hundreds of
			students in the class, each with different projects. It was in this environment, where I had to reach beyond
			the coursework and self-teach myself with online resources and other students, that I was able to thrive.
		</p>
		<p>&emsp;I saw this pattern in the career fairs I attended in Iowa State as well. Many of the employers would
			not only prefer candidates with a strong desire to learn, but also with the motivation to go beyond the
			coursework and explore more, learning programming languages, frameworks, and other paradigms not taught in
			the classroom. I really took home that Lifelong Learning was not necessarily a trait, but a skill that one
			had to cultivate. I now have interests in many fields, and actively pursue personal projects.</p>
		<p>&emsp;If I could do my undergraduate degree over again, I would make a greater effort to take classes related
			to each other in the same semester. As I type this, I am taking 3 courses that have to do with machine
			learning which link the design of the hardware to the software implementations. By taking these courses
			together, I have a greater understanding of how engineers in different jobs and fields collaborate to solve
			problems and make the technology we work with today.</p>
		<p>&emsp;I am proud of the skills and knowledge I have gained throughout my journey at ISU. I am genuinely
			excited about getting to work with a field that is constantly evolving, with new problems and solutions
			emerging that affect everyone from the engineering co-worker, to the neighbor you have next door.</p>


		<h2>CPRE 394 Ethics Essay</h2>
		<p>&emsp;A “Code of Ethics” is important to follow because it gives one a set of guidelines of what is
			unacceptable. When I personally am faced with an ethical dilemma, my own set of personal ethics is applied,
			but also external pressures are how I come to a decision. For example, I wouldn’t do anything as an engineer
			that would break the law.</p>
		<p>&emsp;While it is in my interest to listen to my employer and do the work they tell me, a Code of Ethics
			helps protect me and my employer from legal action. One ethical obligation from the IEEE code of ethics is
			to “accept responsibility in making decisions consistent with the safety… of the public.” If I were to be
			instructed to indirectly endanger the public by my employer, like say program an embedded control system to
			release more toxic waste into a river to decrease costs, I would decline as it is the ethical choice, and
			that waste could intoxicate the drinking water and endanger the public.
		</p>
		<p>&emsp;Threat of legal action isn’t the sole reason why one should follow a set of ethics. Following a code of
			ethics ensures that you make the right decision, despite these outside pressures. One example is how there
			are trivial unenforced laws, like how technically speeding over the speed limit is illegal, but I can speed
			5-10 more mph to stay with the flow of traffic. Officers would only enforce the speed limit when I am
			recklessly driving or endangering others, so my action would be considered ethical, as I am safeguarding the
			public.
		</p>
		<p>&emsp;In class we discussed an ethical dilemma with Big Data where Marcus, a contract computer scientist, is
			given an injury database which breaks privacy laws. Even though Marcus can look the other way and do the
			work to fulfill his contract, it is his best interest not to.</p>
		<p>&emsp;Virtue ethics is an approach to ethics where character and honestly is used to make ethical decisions.
			Under the virtues of honesty and fidelity, Marcus should come out and tell the truth to John, his employer,
			that their actions are not meeting the “Minimum Necessary” standard. To be “faithful” to the public, and to
			safeguard their information, he must not accept the project because the data is sensitive information
			belonging to the medical entity and the paramedics only.</p>
		<p>&emsp;While the virtue of charity argues that this information can help the paramedics, it still doesn’t
			follow the other set of virtues. If one person is ethical, then it helps others from being unethical, not
			just by example, but by the actions of goodwill themselves.
		</p>
		<p>&emsp;Let’s say Marcus chooses the unethical route, and links the data together. What if some malicious actor
			obtained his data set in a data breach. Included in this dataset is the city’s infection control dataset.
			Personal information of everyone in the city could be obtained in a breach, like addresses and phone
			numbers.
		</p>
		<p>&emsp;Ultimately, while the slippery slope argument does not always hold, it can be said that if Marcus takes
			the ethical route, there is zero chance of others also taking an unethical route linked to his actions.
